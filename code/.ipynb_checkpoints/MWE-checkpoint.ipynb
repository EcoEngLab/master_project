    "1. Project background：\n",
    "This project is part of a big new program titled ‘A new Green Revolution: Manipulating the soil microbiome to enhance the sustainability of 21st century agriculture,’. The current focus is to optimise/engineer soil microbiomes to suppress the fungus Gaeumannomyces tritici, which causes the take-all disease in wheat (T. aestivum).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Microbial community coalescence：\n",
    "It is the process by which two distinct microbial communities encounter one another and interact to form a new ‘daughter’ community. This assemblage may more closely resemble one ‘parent’ community than the other, and its functional profile may be totally unique. We plan to use a coalescence method to create new community to fight against take-all disease.\n"
