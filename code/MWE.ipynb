    "It is the process by which two distinct microbial communities encounter one another and interact to form a new ‘daughter’ community. This assemblage may more closely resemble one ‘parent’ community than the other, and its functional profile may be totally unique. We plan to use a coalescence method to create new community to fight against take-all disease.\n"

By doing that, we hope to predict the result of community coalescence through Carbon usage efficiency appearance of species in different temperature.

This controls the relative value of the dirchlet α parameters which determine how the probabiltiy density function is distributed over the different resources. Specialisation is obtained by setting the α values for resources that specialists consume to higher values meaning they have a higher probablity of a larger value. When s_ratio = 1 the proabailtiy is uniform and all resources are equally likely to be consumed. When s_ratio >1 then consumers are more likely to consume resources within thier module."
